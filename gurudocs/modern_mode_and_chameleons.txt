Under modern mode we want all modules to only produce ONE kind of PRIMARY output.
This means we need to split some classic functionality across existing and new
modules to preserve the same overall option registry.  First, let us assess the
extent of the problem.  These modules normally write PostScript, with exceptions:

grdcontour.c		With -D write data table
grdimage.c		With -A write image
psbasemap.c		With -A, write bounding box table
pscoast.c		With -M, -E, write data to stdout
pscontour.c		With -D write data table
pshistogram.c		With -I, write histogram data to stdout
psmask.c		With -D write clip paths to data tables
pssolar.c		With -I or -M writes data to stdout
psternary.c		With -M writes ternary data to stdout

These 4 can write tables or grids:

blockm*.c		Writes data tables but with -A -G writes grids
earthtide.c		Writes data tables but with -C -G writes grids

Here are proposed new modules that allow the 2nd type of output:

gmtcontour.c		Write contours from -Ggrids or tables
gmtcoast.c		Write borders etc.
gmtinsert.c		Write insert coordinates
gmthistogram.c		Write histogram counts
gmtmask.c		Write clip paths
gmtsolar.c		Write terminators
grdblockave.c		Write grids, with option to select which operator
gmtternary.c		Write ternary data
grdearthtide.c		Write solid earth tides

For grdimage it seems we could do something slightly different. Maybe think of -A
as a secondary output and turn off primary output?

Details of wrappers:

gmtcontour.c [-Ggrid] <options>
	If -G is given then setup call to grdcontour -D, else call to pscontour -D

gmtcoast.c -M -E will call pscoast with those options

gmtinsert.c will call psbasemap -A

gmthistogram.c will call pshistogram -I

gmtmask.c will call psmask -D

gmtsolar.c will call pssolar -I or -M

grdblockave.c will call blockm* -G -A

gmtternary.c will call psternary -M

grdearthtide.c will call earthtide -G -A


Furthermore, under modern mode the original modules will loose the options that are moved
to the new wrappers. E.g., grdcontour under modern mode will not expose the -D option,
while pscoast will not expose the -M and -E options for dumping.
