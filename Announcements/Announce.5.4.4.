Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce two new updates for GMT:

  * GMT 5.4.4  - The latest GMT 5 with bug fixes since 5.4.3
  * GMT 4.5.18 - The final GMT 4 release with bug fixes since 4.5.17

These two updates were released on July 1, 2018.
At the same time, the DCW database was updated to 1.1.4.

Note to GMT 4 users: This is the final release of the GMT 4 series,
about 4 years and 8 months after the introduction of GMT 5.  We
are now working only on GMT 6 and its python wrapper, with
anticipated release at the end of this year. Until that time we
will continue to release bug-fix updates to the GMT 5.x series.

Sincerely,

The GMT Team
